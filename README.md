# The Android App Market on Google Play

Time flies, and now we're already entering our third project provided by DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python Track. In the previous lesson, we learned how to visualize our data using both Matplotlib and Seaborn. And also, we had to learn how to construct functions, whether they used default arguments, variable-length arguments, or lambda functions, as well as error handling.


In relation to this project, we are being encouraged to analyze and visualize several problems, i.e., Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market? Visualize the app ratings and plot them on a histogram. Does the price of an app affect its rating? Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps? What is the relationship between app category and app price? Does free apps become more popular than paid apps? And finally, how does sentiment analysis compare paid vs. free apps?

## Project Description

Mobile apps are all over the place. They are simple to make and could be profitable. Because of these two considerations, an increasing number of applications are being produced. In this assignment, you will conduct a thorough research of the Android app industry by analyzing over ten thousand applications from Google Play in several categories. You'll seek for statistical information to develop growth and retention strategies. This project's data has been gathered from the Google Play website. Although there are many famous datasets for Apple App Store applications, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is owing in part to the greater difficulty in scraping the latter over the former. The following are the data files:

- `apps.csv`: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
- `user_reviews.csv`: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.
## Project Tasks
